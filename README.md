1. List: A list is a container that displays rows of data in a vertical scrollable view. It is a common user interface component used in many iOS apps.

2. Navigation Stack: The navigation stack is a way to organize views in a hierarchical manner, allowing users to navigate between different screens in your app. It typically consists of a navigation bar at the top of the screen and a series of views that are pushed onto the stack as the user navigates through the app.

3. Binding: A binding is a two-way connection between a property and a user interface element. When a user interacts with the UI element, the property is updated and vice versa. Bindings are commonly used in SwiftUI to keep the user interface in sync with the underlying data.

4. Environment Variable: An environment variable is a value that is shared across the entire app and can be accessed by any view or view controller. It is a way to provide global configuration or settings that are used throughout the app.

5. State: State is a property wrapper that allows you to store and manage values that can change over time. When a state value changes, SwiftUI automatically updates the user interface to reflect the new value.


6. Simple Tab Bar
